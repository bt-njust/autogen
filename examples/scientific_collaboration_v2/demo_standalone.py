Enhanced Scientific Collaboration V2 Standalone Demo

This demonstration script shows the core functionality and improvements of the enhanced 
scientific collaboration system without requiring any external dependencies.

Key enhancements demonstrated:
1. Enhanced team roles and academic positions
2. Discussion-based consensus (no voting)
3. Topic source identification and assignment mechanisms
4. Valid researcher names using only numbers, '_', '-'
5. Improved state management and termination conditions
