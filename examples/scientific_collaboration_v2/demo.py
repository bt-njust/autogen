Enhanced Scientific Collaboration V2 Demo

This demonstration script shows the structure and capabilities of the enhanced scientific 
collaboration simulation without requiring an OpenAI API key. It demonstrates:

1. Enhanced researcher profiles with team roles and academic positions
2. Topic proposal with source information
3. Discussion-based assessment instead of voting
4. Assignment mechanisms for leaders
5. Termination conditions and improved state tracking

Run this to understand how the enhanced simulation works before setting up with a real API key.
