Demonstration script for the Bibliographic Scientific Collaboration Example

This script shows the structure and capabilities of the bibliographic collaboration
simulation without requiring an OpenAI API key. It demonstrates:

1. Enhanced researcher profiles with bibliographic data
2. Publication pattern analysis and author roles  
3. Network-based role definitions from coauthorship analysis
4. Community detection integration
5. Template-based prompts with placeholder metrics
6. Cross-community collaboration opportunities

Run this to understand how the bibliographic simulation works before setting up with a real API key.
