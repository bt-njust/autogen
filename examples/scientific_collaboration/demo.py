Demonstration script for the Scientific Collaboration Example

This script shows the structure and capabilities of the scientific collaboration
simulation without requiring an OpenAI API key. It demonstrates:

1. Researcher profile creation
2. Topic proposal mechanics  
3. Voting system
4. Collaboration state tracking

Run this to understand how the simulation works before setting up with a real API key.
